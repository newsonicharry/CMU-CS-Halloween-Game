# CMU-CS-Halloween-Game
A pseudo 3d game in python built within the CMU CS Academy sandbox environment. 
It was built in only two days for a school project, but figured it was cool enough to upload on my github. 
If you want to run it within the website you'll either have to rewrite every single line or more realistically use a web response or a macro to write it all for you.
Otherwise its pretty easy to get it running on the desktop version of CMU CS Academy. Because of perfromance limitations of brython it has a lot of performance compromises, but that can all be configured by changing the MAX_DEPTH, PRECISION and LINE_SKIP variables if this is ran on a more powerful computer or using cpython.
